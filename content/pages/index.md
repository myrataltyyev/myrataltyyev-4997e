    title: About
    content: >
      I'm in the last semester of my master studies in a small beautiful city
      called Aachen. Besides studying, I read books, watch movies, solve CTFs
      (Capture the Flags) and do sport. Also I'm open to internship or part-time
      work to get an experience in my field. If you have any suggestion,
      constructive criticism, question or anything to tell, just reach out to
      me.
