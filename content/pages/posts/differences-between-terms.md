Generally ***Information Security*** (aka ***InfoSec***) is used interchangeably with ***Cybersecurity*** and sometimes ***Network Security*** too. Although they have overlapping areas of application, in fact they are different. In this short article I will explain the differences between them.

## Information Security

Lets start with the broadest of these terms. Information security existed way before the computers. People used security measures to transfer sensitive information on paper, which could be read by anyone, but without specific knowledge would be hard to understand. One way to secure this type of information is to use cryptography. For example, Caesar cipher is the most well known ancient cryptographic primitive. So, information security may not even involve the computers (but it also may, as we will see later). For example, paper shredder is an information security tool. People talking about sensitive information where no unauthorized party and recording devices exist is also an example of information security procedure.

## Cybersecurity

With digital era, information is also digitalized. Computing devices are the main sources of digital information. To protect the digital data, its storage devices must be secured. Hence, security of computers themselves are ensured. Computer Security is the same as Cybersecurity and they are subset of information security. Cybersecurity is bounded by securing computer data, it cannot be related to physical data e.g. sheets with sensitive information.

## Network Security

As the name implies, network security is closely related to networking. It pertains to securing data in networks.

To understand these terms better, here are the examples. Securing data transmitted over the computer network involves all three terms - network security, cybersecurity, information security. Securing data that is stored on a digital device isolated from the network is not related to network security, but it is cybersecurity and information security. Destroying the paper with sensitive financial information by burning or putting it through shredder is neither network security nor cybersecurity, but it is information security.

> As Bruce Schneier says: "Security is a process, not a product". By this sentence, he means that no product (antivirus, password manager etc.) can help in securing your data once and for always.  Sustained attention is the key to secure your information.
